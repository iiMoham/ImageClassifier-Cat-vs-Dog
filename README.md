# Image Classifier

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training an image classification model using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing of image datasets
- Model training using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Performance evaluation and accuracy metrics
- Visualization of training progress

## 🛠 Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iiMoham/image-classifier.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd image-classifier
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook imageClassifier.ipynb
```
4. Run the cells in order to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📊 Results
After training, the model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. Visualizations of training progress and sample predictions will be included in the notebook.
